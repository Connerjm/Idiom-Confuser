## Introduction

I wanted to make a simple application that would randomly confuse two idioms into one sentence, so I did. It's a simple little application that pulls entries from a couple of arrays to create a new bit of nonsense, which is created at the push of the button. I will most likely keep adding to this to practice new concepts and such.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

- HTML
- CSS with Bootstrap 5.0.0
- JavaScript with jQuery 3.5.1

## Launch

## Images

Nice and simple.
